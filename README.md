# FinalProject17
Anti-social party game
The game name will be "INSERT NAME HERE". In "INSERT NAME HERE" the player will
be playing as an introverted high school student who is forced to go to a party
by his or her best friend. When the player arrives at the party he/she is ditched
by his/her best friend and must survive the party by going through several social
situations such as talking to new people, talking to his/her crush, bumping into someone,
or getting hit on. With each situation that is met the player will be given a set of choices that are each valued differently.
For example, one choice will be worth 0, another is -10, another -20. Based on the player's choice, his/her social meter/ health bar will go down by that value.
The point of the game is to complete all of the situations without their social meter going down to 0.
