Anti-social party game
The name of the game is called: "The Anti-Social Party Game". In the game the player will
be playing as an introverted high school student who is forced to go to a party
by his or her best friend. When the player arrives at the party he/she is ditched
by his/her best friend and must survive the party by going through several social
situations such as talking to new people, talking to his/her crush, bumping into someone, or playing some party games.
The player is given choices with these situations and if he or she chooses a bad choice, the player's health bar, or "social life" will go down by a random integer.
The point of the game is to survive the party without your social life points reaching 0.
My game contains several types of code such as functions, classes, lists, dictionaries, the print function, inputs, if statements and while loops.
Functions are used to display certain scenarios throughout the game and are also used as a way to decrease the amount of life you have.
I used classes to create some of the responses and descriptions of the characters within the game to save me some time and lines of code.
